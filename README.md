dataminingProject: Sama Source Gold Gating Algorthim
=================
Our gating algorthim requires a SamaSource generated json file.

To run our file, please just enter
```
python runner.py json_data_file.json
```

Our data files are
```
data/Getty_Training1.json
data/Getty_Training2.json
data/Getty_Validation.json
```
These files were generated by running the Training_Validation_Generator.py file on a master download from SamaSource's data warehouse.

h2 Parameters

The optional parameter of batch may be passed in the command line with the parameter batch:
```
python runner.py data/Getty_Training1.json batch 892
```
If there is no batch with that number, or not batch specified, the script will default to the batch with the most tasks in the branch.

Plottings contains a number of functions that can be called to run graphs of the existing data.
h2 Dependencies

Our runner script has the following dependencies:
 - Numpy
 - Scipy
 - Scikit learn
 - Matplot Lib
 
h2 Old Code: the project's graveyard

A monty carlo simulation was developed for the threshold parameters and though not currently used, can be investigated to see what it outputs.
Other unused bits of code can be found in the ```old`` folder.
